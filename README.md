# Cancer-Detection-by-Image-Processing- 
in this code, image processing is useed to detect cancer in PET-CT scans. the algorithm utilizes RGB.split function to obtain an image with individual green bands and another image with individual blue bands. 
the images were then reduced from one another resulting in an image of the tumor separate from the rest of the organ. 
the area of the tumor and the area of the lung was computed, the ratio of the two was calculated providing an estimate to the severity of the tumor growth in the patient.
